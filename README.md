A really simple IRC bot for my own amusement purposes.

Features
--------
* Dynamic reloading of modules on-the-fly so the bot does not need to be
  restarted. Ruby makes this rather easy.
* A few stupid modules to support my childish IRC activities:
  * YouTube: fetch youtube urls and tell the title, rating etc. to channel
  * Twitter: show contents of a twitter link
  * Newstitle: fetch and shout title to channel for popular Finnish news sites 
    when somene posts an url to a piece of news
  * Monkey: reply stupidly with regexps, e.g. when someone says anything
    containing "banana", the bot may reply something stupid like 
    "mm, yummy banana!".
  * LMGTFY: support being a smartass by giving a lmgtfy link
